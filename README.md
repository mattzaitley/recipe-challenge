This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run:
yarn install
yarn watch

## Assumptions made:
- API response is consistent and not corrupted
- Youtube URLs are not malformed
- Users are using modern browsers
- The app will eventually need Redux (right now it's a bit light for it)
- The youtube video is preferred to the image thumbnail
- The API never errors and everything is perfect 😏

Thanks for your consideration! Happy to chat about testing, how to scale/expand on it, etc!
